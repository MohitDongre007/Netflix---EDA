# Netflix---EDA
This Netflix EDA project analyzed the platformâ€™s content library to uncover trends and insights. I have found that movies dominate the catalog compared to TV shows, with a significant rise in content additions over recent years. The most popular genres include Drama, Comedy, and Documentaries. The United States leads in content production, followed by India and the United Kingdom. I've also identified the most frequent directors and actors on Netflix and examined content durations. This analysis provides valuable insights into content strategy and regional preferences.

I have attached the dataset required for this and the project code file. Please go through it, hope you find this helpfull. Thankyou.


In any case you are not being able to see the visualizations that are the graphical representations, I advice you to run each and every cell of code one by one instead of running the whole  code all at once. Thankyou.
